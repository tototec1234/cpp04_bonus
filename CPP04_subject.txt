C++ - Module 04
Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, andInterfaces
Summary: This document contains the exercises for Module 04 of the C++ modules.
Version: 12.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General rules
Compiling
•Compile your code with c++ and the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror
•Your code should still compile if you add the flag -std=c++98
Formatting and naming conventions
•The exercise directories will be named this way: ex00, ex01, ... , exn
•Name your files, classes, functions, member functions and attributes as required in
the guidelines.
•Write class names in UpperCamelCase format. Files containing class code will
always be named according to the class name. For instance:
ClassName.hpp/ClassName.h, ClassName.cpp, or ClassName.tpp. Then, if you
have a header file containing the definition of a class "BrickWall" standing for a
brick wall, its name will be BrickWall.hpp.
•Unless specified otherwise, every output message must end with a newline character
and be displayed to the standard output.
•Goodbye Norminette! No coding style is enforced in the C++ modules. You can
follow your favorite one. But keep in mind that code your peer evaluators can’t
understand is code they can’t grade. Do your best to write clean and readable code.
Allowed/Forbidden
You are not coding in C anymore. Time to C++! Therefore:
•You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library. Thus, instead
of sticking to what you already know, it would be smart to use the C++-ish versions
of the C functions you are used to as much as possible.
•However, you can’t use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived
forms) and Boost libraries are forbidden. The following functions are forbidden
too: *printf(), *alloc() and free(). If you use them, your grade will be 0 and
that’s it.

C++ - Module 04 Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces
•Note that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the using namespace <ns_name> and
friend keywords are forbidden. Otherwise, your grade will be -42.
•You are allowed to use the STL only in Modules 08 and 09. That means:
no Containers (vector/list/map, and so forth) and no Algorithms (anything that
requires including the <algorithm> header) until then. Otherwise, your grade will
be -42.
A few design requirements
•Memory leakage occurs in C++ too. When you allocate memory (by using the new
keyword), you must avoid memory leaks.
•From Module 02 to Module 09, your classes must be designed in the Orthodox
Canonical Form, except when explicitly stated otherwise.
•Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates)
means 0 to the exercise.
•You should be able to use each of your headers independently from others. Thus,
they must include all the dependencies they need. However, you must avoid the
problem of double inclusion by adding include guards. Otherwise, your grade will
be 0.
Read me
•You can add some additional files if you need to (i.e., to split your code). As these
assignments are not verified by a program, feel free to do so as long as you turn in
the mandatory files.
•Sometimes, the guidelines of an exercise look short but the examples can show
requirements that are not explicitly written in the instructions.
•Read each module completely before starting! Really, do it.
•By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!
Regarding the Makefile for C++ projects, the same rules as in C apply
(see the Norm chapter about the Makefile).
You will have to implement a lot of classes. This can seem tedious,
unless you’re able to script your favorite text editor.

ou are given a certain amount of freedom to complete the exercises.
However, follow the mandatory rules and don’t be lazy. You would
miss a lot of useful information! Do not hesitate to read about
theoretical concepts.

Exercise 00: Polymorphism
Exercise : 00
Polymorphism
Turn-in directory: ex00/
Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, *.cpp, *.{h, hpp}
Forbidden functions: None
For every exercise, you have to provide the most complete tests you can.
Constructors and destructors of each class must display specific messages. Don’t use the
same message for all classes.
Start by implementing a simple base class called Animal. It has one protected
attribute:
•std::string type;
Implement a Dog class that inherits from Animal.
Implement a Cat class that inherits from Animal.
These two derived classes must set their type field depending on their name. Then,
the Dog’s type will be initialized to "Dog", and the Cat’s type will be initialized to "Cat".
The type of the Animal class can be left empty or set to the value of your choice.
Every animal must be able to use the member function:
makeSound()
It will print an appropriate sound (cats don’t bark).

Running this code should print the specific sounds of the Dog and Cat classes, not
the Animal’s.
int main()
{
const Animal* meta = new Animal();
const Animal* j = new Dog();
const Animal* i = new Cat();
std::cout << j->getType() << " " << std::endl;
std::cout << i->getType() << " " << std::endl;
i->makeSound(); //will output the cat sound!
j->makeSound();
meta->makeSound();
...
return 0;
}
To ensure you understood how it works, implement a WrongCat class that inherits
from a WrongAnimal class. If you replace the Animal and the Cat by the wrong ones
in the code above, the WrongCat should output the WrongAnimal sound.
Implement and turn in more tests than the ones given above.

Exercise 01: I don’t want to set the
world on fire
Exercise : 01
I don’t want to set the world on fire
Turn-in directory: ex01/
Files to turn in: Files from previous exercise + *.cpp, *.{h, hpp}
Forbidden functions: None
Constructors and destructors of each class must display specific messages.
Implement a Brain class. It contains an array of 100 std::string called ideas.
This way, Dog and Cat will have a private Brain* attribute.
Upon construction, Dog and Cat will create their Brain using new Brain();
Upon destruction, Dog and Cat will delete their Brain.
In your main function, create and fill an array of Animal objects. Half of it will
be Dog objects and the other half will be Cat objects. At the end of your program
execution, loop over this array and delete every Animal. You must delete directly dogs
and cats as Animals. The appropriate destructors must be called in the expected order.
Don’t forget to check for memory leaks.
A copy of a Dog or a Cat mustn’t be shallow. Thus, you have to test that your copies
are deep copies!

C++ - Module 04 Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces
int main()
{
const Animal* j = new Dog();
const Animal* i = new Cat();
delete j;//should not create a leak
delete i;
...
return 0;
}
Implement and turn in more tests than the ones given above.

Exercise 02: Abstract class
Exercise : 02
Abstract class
Turn-in directory: ex02/
Files to turn in: Files from previous exercise + *.cpp, *.{h, hpp}
Forbidden functions: None
Creating Animal objects doesn’t make sense after all. It’s true, they make no sound!
To avoid any possible mistakes, the default Animal class should not be instantiable.
Fix the Animal class so that nobody can instantiate it. Everything should work as before.
If you want to, you can update the class name by adding an A prefix to Animal.
